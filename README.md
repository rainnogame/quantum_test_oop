## Goal

You have 3 different models to solve MNIST (handwritten digits database) classification
problem:

- Convolutional Neural Network (any architecture, any framework);
    - Input: tensor 28x28x1;
- Random Forest classifier;
    - Input: 1-d numpy array of length 784 (28x28 pixels);
- Model that provides random value (for simplicity) as a result of classification;
    - Input: 10x10 numpy array, the center crop of the image.

The goal is to build a DigitClassifier model that takes an algorithm as an input parameter. Possible values for the
algorithm are: cnn, rf, rand for the three models described above.

There is NO need to implement a training function inside DigitClassifier and focus on the quality of the model, just
raise a Not implemented exception. We need to focus only on the predict function that takes a 28x28x1 image as input and
provides a single integer value as output.

Ideally, the solution should contain:

- Interface for models like Convolutional Neural Network, Random Forest classifier, Random model. Potentially other
  developers will develop new models, so we need to have an interface for them. Letâ€™s call it
  DigitClassificationInterface.
- 3 classes (1 for each model) that implement DigitClassificationInterface.
- DigitClassifier, which takes as an input parameter the name of the algorithm and provides predictions with exactly the
  same structure (inputs and outputs) not depending on the selected algorithm.

## Implementation notes

Code structure

- `digits_classifiers/classifiers/base.pt` - contains the interface for classification models
- `digits_classifiers/classifiers/cnn.py` - contains the implementation of the CNN model
- `digits_classifiers/classifiers/rf.py` - contains the implementation of the Random Forest model
- `digits_classifiers/classifiers/rand.py` - contains the implementation of the Random model
- `digits_classifiers/digit_classifier.py` - contains the implementation of the DigitClassifier
- `digits_classifiers/classifiers_factory.py` - contains the factory for the classifiers

Implemented under `python v3.12`

To install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

To add new model you need to

- Extend `src.classifiers.base.DigitClassificationInterface`
- Add model as an option to a factory `from src.classifiers_factory.ClassifiersFactory`

## Important notes

- As a source dataset I selected `mnist_784` data from `sklearn.fetch_openml('mnist_784')`
- For a convenience models training and prediction are based on batch input
- Despite the fact that in task it's said to use `28x28x1` input, I used `1x28x28` seems it's more convenient as for me.
  I don't think this change in the rules is important
- Written test is artificial and cannot be considered as a production-ready test
- A lot if important staff for a production-ready code were skipped
    - Logging
    - Unit tests
    - Configurations
    - Input checks
    - etc
